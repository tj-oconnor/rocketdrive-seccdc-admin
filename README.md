## üõ† Building the Images

You can build either the **demo** or **live** images using `make`:

Demo are to be released to competitors for analysis
Live is run in the target environment and contains a flag

### **Build Demo Image**
```sh
make demo
```
This will:
- Initialize the demo database (`init_demo_db.py`)
- Replace `app/files/` with `demo_files/`
- Build the `demo` Docker image
- Tag and commit it to `tjoconnor/rocketdrive-demo`

### **Build Live Image**
```sh
make live
```
This will:
- Initialize the live database (`init_live_db.py`)
- Replace `app/files/` with `live_files/`
- Build the `live` Docker image
- Tag and commit it to `tjoconnor/rocketdrive-live`
- Save the built image as `live-image`

## üèÉ Running the CTF Images

Once built, you can run either the demo or live images:

### **Run the Demo Image**
```sh
docker run -p 8000:80 demo
```
### **Run the Live Image**
```sh
docker run -p 8000:80 live
```
The application will be accessible at:
üåç **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

## üõ∞Ô∏è Pulling Prebuilt Images from DockerHub
If you don't want to build the images manually, you can pull the prebuilt ones:

### **Pull and Run Demo Image**
```sh
docker pull tjoconnor/rocketdrive-demo
docker run -p 8000:80 tjoconnor/rocketdrive-demo
```

### **Pull and Run Live Image**
```sh
docker pull tjoconnor/rocketdrive-live
docker run -p 8000:80 tjoconnor/rocketdrive-live
```

## üîì Cracking the Hashes
A script exists for brute-forcing stored hashes:
```sh
solution/brute-force-hash.py
```
This script will attempt to crack stored password hashes in the challenge. Note, there is a high-rate of collisions due to the poor algorithm implementation. The recovered password will work but may not be the original password.
