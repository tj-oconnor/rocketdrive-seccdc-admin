            <h1>RocketDrive Animal Testing Statement</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>RocketDrive stands firmly against the use of animals in space exploration or file storage experiments. The historical use of dogs by the Russians during early space exploration and the infamous RFC 1149 "avian carrier" for data transmission were not only unnecessary but also lacked respect for our fellow living beings.</p>
            <p>We strongly advocate for ethical approaches in technology and exploration. At RocketDrive, our solutions are built on the principles of innovation, sustainability, and respect for life. We believe in a future where the bytes in the clouds are reached without harm to any creatures.</p>
            <p>Let’s leave the animal testing in the past and focus on building a better, more compassionate tomorrow—for all inhabitants of our universe.</p>
